        <br/><br/>

        <p>I'm Karly, a senior at Harvard studying computer science and math with a concurrent master's in CS. 
            I'm also exploring philosophy, economics, writing, linguistics, and some other bits!
        </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Building for education at <a href="https://www.wavelf.org/">Wave Learning Festival</a> (serving 20,000+ students online and 600+ schools—join us!)</li>

            </ul>
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p>Previously, I've worked on:
            <ul>
                <li>Research on systems simulations, comp neuro, education and hiring interventions @ Harvard</li>

        <br/>

        <p>I did the closing keynote at the 2021 <a href="https://www.womeninanalytics.com/">Women in Analytics Conference</a>, and have also spoken at places including
            the <a href="https://www.asugsvsummit.com/">ASU + GSV Summit</a>, North American Tsinghua Conference, Sister Cities International, and AI4Action.
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p>At school, I've met wonderful people while serving an <a href="https://www.huwics.com/">incredibly passionate community of women in CS</a>, 
            launching a <a href="https://www.prod.so/">student-run/VC-backed startup incubator</a>, organizing the <a href="https://www.harvardwecode.com/">world's largest student-run women in tech conference</a>, 
            and outlining plans for <a href="https://www.hucbe.org/">improved healthcare and SME growth in Latin America</a>. I sometimes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-t9XiUgs2Vs">dance</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_GE2N2Rrogo&t=3798s">sing</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ljbpGl-qfdU">sing but in Korea</a>, play violin,
            powerlift, and shoot fashion editorials. I love teaching (probability, CS, art history) and believe anyone can learn anything. Learning new languages is fun
            (working on Mandarin, Spanish, French, German). I'm thankful to mentors at the <a href="https://sici.hks.harvard.edu/homepage/new-world-social-innovation-fellowship/#">Cheng Fellowship</a>, 
            <a href="https://www.hbs.edu/mba/roberts-family-fellows/Pages/profiles.aspx">Roberts Family Fellowship</a>, and <a href="https://innovationlabs.harvard.edu/">Innovation Lab</a> for encouraging me to mess around. 
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p>
            Perhaps most importantly, I think our world is overflowing with immeasurable beauty. I hope we get to notice it, create more of it,
            let ourselves discover wonder and awe over and over again. I love art (especially the new kind). I think holding myself to high standards is the best form of self-care.
            I think we should all dare to be many things and forgo the limitations of labels. I am looking for people who feel how precious this life is and chase freedom relentlessly.
